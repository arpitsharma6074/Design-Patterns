The Facade Design Pattern is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified
interface to a complex system of classes, libraries, or frameworks.

Think of it as a front desk in a hotel â€“ instead of directly contacting housekeeping,
room service, and maintenance individually, you just call the front desk (facade),
which internally communicates with the right department.
