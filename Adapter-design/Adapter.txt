The adapter design pattern is a structural design pattern that acts as a
bridge between two incompatible interfaces, allowing objects with different
interfaces to work together by converting one interface into another that
clients expect. It acts as a wrapper or mediator, translating requests from
the client into a format the target object understands without modifying the
client or the target's original source code. This pattern is particularly useful
for integrating existing code, such as legacy systems, into new applications.
