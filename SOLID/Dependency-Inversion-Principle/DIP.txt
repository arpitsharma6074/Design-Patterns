The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not
depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally,
abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

This principle is often confused with dependency injection but is a broader concept.
It promotes loose coupling between components.
