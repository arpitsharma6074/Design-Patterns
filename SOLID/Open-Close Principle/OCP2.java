If you wanted to add a new shape, like a Triangle, youâ€™d have to modify
the AreaCalculator class in previous inmplementation.
To follow OCP, you can use a common interface.

interface Shape {

Now, to add a new shape, you just need to create a new class that implements
the Shape interface. The AreaCalculator class remains unchanged.
